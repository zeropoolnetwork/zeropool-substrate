# ZeroPool substrate pallet

## Run the full environment
This will start an instance of each: substrate node, zeropool-relayer, zeropool-console (web console for testing):
`docker-compose -f docker-compose.full.yml up`

Optionally, provide the `DOCKER_GATEWAY_HOST` variable if running on a remote server.
